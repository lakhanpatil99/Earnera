You are now acting as a senior product designer and Android UI engineer.

Take the existing Earnera Android frontend project and upgrade it into a real-world earning app like TaskBucks, MPL, or RozDhan.

This is still FRONTEND ONLY.
Do NOT add backend.
Use SharedPreferences for fake wallet.

-----------------------------------
🧩 1. ADD REFERRAL SYSTEM (UI)
-----------------------------------
In the Wallet screen:
Add a new section above Withdraw:

Title: "Invite & Earn"
Card showing:
- Referral code (fake)
- Button: Copy Code
- Button: Share on WhatsApp
- Text: "Earn 50 coins per friend"

Design it with gradient, icons, and card layout.

-----------------------------------
💰 2. IMPROVE WITHDRAW UI
-----------------------------------
Redesign Withdraw section:

- Large stylish balance card
- Slider to select coins to withdraw
- Show ₹ conversion live
- "Withdraw Now" button
- Show UPI field (UI only)
- Show "Processing..." animation when clicked

-----------------------------------
📄 3. ADD EARNING INSTRUCTIONS PANEL
-----------------------------------
On Home Screen:
Add a "How to Earn" card:
- Watch Ads
- Daily Check-in
- Invite Friends
- Complete Tasks
With icons and bullet layout

-----------------------------------
📤 4. ADD SHARE & PROMO BANNERS
-----------------------------------
Add scrolling banner on Home:
"Earn up to ₹500 per day!"
"Invite friends & get bonus!"

Add Share button:
"Share Earnera App"

-----------------------------------
🎨 5. FIX TASK INSTRUCTION UI
-----------------------------------
Redesign TaskInstructionActivity and TaskProgressActivity:

Make them look like a real fintech earning flow:
- Full screen gradient
- Animated coins
- Big reward display
- Stylish instruction cards
- Glowing Start button
- Coin burst on completion

-----------------------------------
🧠 6. UI STYLE
-----------------------------------
Apply across app:
- Rounded cards (24dp)
- Soft shadows
- Poppins / Inter fonts
- Gradient buttons
- Bottom navigation animation
- Smooth transitions

-----------------------------------
⚠️ IMPORTANT
-----------------------------------
Do not remove existing logic.
Do not break wallet or tasks.
Only add features and UI layers.

The final app should look like a Play Store–ready earning app.
